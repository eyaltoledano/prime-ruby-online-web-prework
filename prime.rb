#  See if an integer n can be divided by each number in turn that is less than n

# A simple but slow method of checking the primality of a given number n, called trial division, tests whether n is a multiple of any integer between 2 and square root of n

# How do I know if a number is a multiple of 3?
# Divisibility by 3 or 9. First, take any number (for this example it will be 492) and add together each digit in the number (4 + 9 + 2 = 15). Then take that sum (15) and determine if it is divisible by 3. The original number is divisible by 3 (or 9) if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3 (or 9).

number = 5
numbers = Array.new(number) # makes an array as with as many elements as the number

def is_multiple?(number)
  numbers = Array.new(number)
end


def prime?(number)
